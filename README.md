# Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) Testing

## Introduction
A playground repo for testing some Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving simple differential equations.
The toy models will be based on the formulation of [M. Raissi, P. Perdikaris and G.E. Karniadakis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021999118307125) and are meant as an initial exploration of this new topic from personal interest.

## Models
- **Solving_ODE.ipynb**: A toy model solution to a harmonic oscillator for demonstration purposes

## Resources
Given the limited number of formal resources online, I used the following videos to get a better idea of the hands-on implementation details:
- [Matthieu Barreau - Physics-Informed Learning: Using Neural Networks to Solve Differential Equations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4ZvksarJ1Q)
- [A Hands-on Introduction to Physics-informed Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JaZGWekWQ)
